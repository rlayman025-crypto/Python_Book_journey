My Python Learning Journey:
I’m documenting my journey learning Python by working through the book Automate the Boring Stuff with Python by Al Sweigart.
Currently, I’m on page 260 and I’ll be documenting my progress from my last stop onward.
This repository will contain daily practice projects, exercises, and notes as I continue learning Python.
